# Multiple Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent

1. It is a regression problem. I predict the home price.

2. First, I understood the data. Then I make some strategies to deal with data and solve the problem in a possible way.

3. Second, I created some graphical charts to look at data behavior and the shape of the data.

4. Third, I used some data preprocessing techniques to convert the categorical data into numerical form and also used some data selection techniques.

5. Fourth, I used the Scikit-learn library to build model, check the validation of model, and evaluation of the model.

6. Now I'm still working on model improvement.
